# DevOps Engineer - technical interview

## Testing goals
With this test, we want to see your ability to create an entire infrastructure from scratch as well as your skills as a system administrator.

## The task
Your task is to provision a highly available /[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)/[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)/[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)/CMS of your choice/. The entry point of the cluster should be a host and port 443.

## The solution
In your solution please emphasize on readability, maintainability and DevOps methodologies. We expect a clear way to recreate your setup.

Use git. We like seeing history of small improvements instead of big pushes with unclear goals.

If you wish, you can use a configuration management tool (Ansible, Terraform, Chef, Puppet). The infrastructure provider is up to you (Google Cloud, Kubernetes, AWS and Vagrant are all good).

It is not required to implement all the features you can think of. A clean bare minimum working infrastructure is preferred than a full blown solution pieced together with scissors, rope and duct tape. Do not skip security considerations.

## When you are finished
Submit your solution to a Github repository and send us a link.
It is very unlikely, but not impossible that this test will change. It's always a good idea to fork this repository before you begin.
